Edit the `.env` file. Put correct values for each variable otherwise the bot will not work as intended.

```env
token = 68474524156455441541564564
welcome_channel = fwfwfwfwffwefw

```

These values are just for example

# Usage/Examples
After setting up all the id's generate a url from discord developer portal and make the bot join your server. You can name your bot whatever you want. 
**Turn on all the intents options available on the discord developer portal**. Intents are a crucial part of this bot.

If everything is done right, then you are pretty much done. Now just execute the `main.py` file.
